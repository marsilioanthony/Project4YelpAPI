# Project 4 - Sentiment and NLP Analysis of Yelp Reviews
<p><b> In this project my goal was to get an idea of how Yelp reviews from
Montana compare to those in New York for steakhouses. My idea with this was related to
Montana's abundance and proximity to choice beef, and New York's less abundance of that
type of resource. <b></p>
<p> I found that there really wasn't much of a difference in the sentiment of the reviews in
Montana from New York. New York was roughly a bit less positive, however I think some of that
can be attributed to sampling/random error and that it does not in fact carry much meaning.</p>
