# Project 4 - Sentiment and NLP Analysis of Yelp Reviews
<p> In this project my goal was to get an idea of how Yelp reviews from
Montana compare to those in New York for steakhouses. My idea with this was related to
Montana's abundance and proximity to choice beef, and New York's less abundance of that
type of resource. </p>
